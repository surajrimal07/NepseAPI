### üìÑ License

This project is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE) to encourage open-source collaboration while maintaining proper attribution.

## Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

1. **REST API Server** (`server.py`)
   - Built with FastAPI
   - Provides HTTP endpoints for market data
   - Runs on port 8000
   - Supports CORS
   - Uses uvicorn as the ASGI server

2. **WebSocket Server** (`socketServer.py`)
   - Provides real-time data streaming
   - Runs on port 5555
   - Supports bidirectional communication

3. **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`) - **NEW**
   - Model Context Protocol server for AI integration
   - Provides structured access to all stock data endpoints
   - Compatible with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients
   - Enables AI models to query Nepal stock market data

## Installation

```sh
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Quick Start - All Servers

**Cross-platform (Recommended):**
```bash
python start_servers.py
```

**Windows (Double-click):**
```bash
# Double-click start_servers.bat
# OR run in PowerShell:
.\start_servers.bat
```

**Alternative methods:**
```bash
# Manual startup script for Windows
python start_servers.py

# Or start individual components
python server.py          # FastAPI server
python socketServer.py    # WebSocket server
python mcp_server.py      # MCP server
```

### Starting Individual Servers

```sh
# Start REST API server
python server.py

# Start WebSocket server
python socketServer.py

# Start MCP server (for AI integration)
python mcp_server.py
```

### MCP Server Integration


The MCP server enables AI models (like Claude) to directly access Nepal stock market data using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) via FastMCP.

Here are some examples of the MCP server in action:

**Stock Analysis**
![Stock Analysis](public/claude_stock_analysis.png)

**Market Depth**

**NEPSE Index**

**Sub-indices**
![Sub-indices](public/claude_subindex.png)



#### How to Run the MCP Server

**Local (for Claude Desktop, stdio):**

In your `mcp_server.py`, ensure you start the server with stdio transport for local integration:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```

**Remote (HTTP, for hosted or networked use):**

To run the MCP server as a remote HTTP service (e.g., for network/hosted access):

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=PORT)
```

#### Claude Desktop Integration

1. **Install `uv` globally** (required for Claude Desktop to find it):

   - **On macOS and Linux:**
     ```sh
     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - **On Windows:**
     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
     ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop**

   Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` (adjust the path to your `mcp_server.py`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "nepseapi-mcp-server": {
         "command": "uv",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--with", "fastmcp",
           "--with", "requests",
           "--with", "pydantic",
           "python",
           "C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Work/NepseAPI/mcp_server.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   - If you are running the MCP server remotely (HTTP), you can point Claude Desktop to the hosted MCP server instead of running it locally.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

4. The AI can now use tools like:
   - `get_market_summary` - Get current market overview
   - And 20+ more tools for comprehensive market analysis

**Test MCP Server:**
```sh
python test_mcp.py
```

### üåê Using Hosted Service (Free Access)

Instead of setting up locally, you can use the free hosted service with rate limits:

**REST API:**
```bash
# Use hosted REST API
curl "https://nepseapi.surajrimal.dev/health"
curl "https://nepseapi.surajrimal.dev/Summary"
curl "https://nepseapi.surajrimal.dev/validate/stock/NABIL"
```

**WebSocket Connection:**
```javascript
// Connect to hosted WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://nepseapi.surajrimal.dev/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));
```

**MCP Server for Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nepse-hosted": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch"],
      "env": {
        "FETCH_BASE_URL": "https://nepseapimcp.surajrimal.dev"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Rate Limits Apply**: The hosted service has reasonable rate limits to ensure fair usage. Please do not abuse the free service.

**üõë Hosted Service Reliability Notice**:
- This service is provided as a **generous gesture** for educational convenience
- **No guarantee** of availability, uptime, or continued operation
- **No support provided** for service outages or issues
- **May be discontinued** without notice at any time
- **Use local deployment** for any critical or production needs
